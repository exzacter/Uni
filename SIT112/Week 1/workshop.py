# Printing hello World
# using the print command and ("") anything inside the brackets and quotes will be printed inside the terminal when command is run
# For example:
print("This is an example on how to use the command 'print'")
# Classic Hello world!:
print("Hello World!")

# We can specify a list by passing through the variables like so:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

print(type(a))

# We can then print all the values inside this list by calling the variable 'a'

print(a)

# Variable assignment:

x = 10
y = "This is a string"

print("x = ", x)
print("y = {0} -> {1}".format(x,y))
print("y = ", y)

print(type(y))
print(type(x))

# you can reassign a value or variable by recalling the variable with a new set value

print(x)

x = 11
print("I have now set a new value for 'x'")
print(x)

# inside notebook the following command would print an output, hwoever not in that i need to place a print() command around it 
type(x)
