# Commenting
To comment in Python3 you use the "#". This will allow you to comment the entire line if placed at the start of the line or comment out from where you place the "#" to the end of the line.

# Variables and Types

## Assignment
The assignment operator in python3 is '='. Python3 is a dynamically typed language and therefor you do not need to specify the type of variable while creating it.
